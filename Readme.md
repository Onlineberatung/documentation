# Online-Beratung Documentation

This is the repository containing the Online-Beratung Documentation.

## Hints

### Local start

To run the documentation locally you need to do the following steps:

1. switch to `website`directory
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm start`

This will start a local webserver with hot-reloading, so you can view your changes directly in the automatically opened 
webpage.

### Sidebar changes (new Pages / new Categories)

Pages and categories of the sidebar are defined in `website\sidebars.json`.

Notes:

- These changes require a server-restart
- If you add a page, the structure is `<folder>/<page-id>`

### New page

New pages need a header which defines an id and a title for the page like the following:

`---`\
`id: keycloak`\
`title: 3rd party - Keycloak`\
`---`

## Publish the documentation

This documentation is automatically published to GitHub pages on any merges to `master` via GitHub workflow.
