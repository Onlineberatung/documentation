In general: A distinction is made between a test browser matrix and the matrix of supported browsers.
The test browser matrix defines the browsers in which each new component is tested. Each additional browser increases the testing effort for each new component. The matrix of supported browsers defines those browsers, which are supported in general by the frontend, but are not tested explicitly.

Example: Firefox and Chrome release new browser versions every 6 weeks. The latest Chrome/Firefox version will be included in the test matrix. In the matrix of supported browsers are all Firefox versions of the past 1.5 years.
This ensures that these browser versions are supported, with a lower test effort.

Following recommendation can be derived from the following parameters:
* Use of the browser in the global statistics or from "high priority" countries.
* Threshold test effort for additional browsers.
* Standard conformability of the respective browser in order to be able to classify additional efforts required to support this browser.

There is also a distinction between "fully supported browsers" and "functionally supported browsers". Full supported browsers are browsers in which both, functionality and visuality must completely be in line according to the specification. Functionally supported means that within these browsers, the basic functionality of the page must be accessible for the user, i.e. all information is available/accessible, but there may be reductions in design and user experience. This may vary depending on browser, browser version and features used.
