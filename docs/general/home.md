## Project Description

Psychosocial counseling for people in difficult life situations is an essential task of Caritas. Caritas follows the approach of blended counseling which means the systematic and conceptually tailored combination of various digital and analog communication channels in counseling.

In Caritas and its professional associations there are more than 4000 counseling centers nationwide in the most diverse subject areas. Meanwhile 20 of these subject areas are active in online counseling. In order for this counseling to be networked and tailored to the needs of the individual, Caritas has decided to develop its own counseling platform.
The Caritas online counseling service is a user-centered, responsive, data protection-compliant and browser-based counseling platform on which psychosocial counseling between those seeking advice and professionals can take place.
For offering this professional counseling service online it is important that:

- anonymity is possible,
- different fields of expertise can be reached and combined,
- varying consulting settings can be chosen.

There is also a need for such advisory platforms in other sectors, so that we would like to make our developments available to the general public and encourage joint further development.
Caritas' work on this platform is supported by the German Federal Ministry of Family Affairs.

In this documentation you will find information on how to set up, run and contribute to the project.
