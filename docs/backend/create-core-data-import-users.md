# Entering Data

## Obtaining an authorization token

In order to use the REST APIs to populate the system with data, one has to obtain an authorization bearer token first.


## AgencyService: Agency and Diocese CRUD

For the AgencyService, master data (consulting offices, etc.) must be created. By default, one example consulting agency is created in the system at setup.
For this purpose, the following REST API endpoints should be used (note the order):

### Create dioceses


### Create agencies


## UserService: Consultants CRUD



### Description of the fields
| Field | Description |
|------|--------------|
| consultant_id | Keycloak-ID |
| id_old | ID from the old consulting platform |
| username | Username |
| first_name | First name |
| last_name | Last name |
| email | E-mail address |
| is_absent | Specifies whether a consultant should be set to absent. Permitted values: yes/no |
| absence_message | Absence note |
| agency_rolesets | Consulting center ID; role in the consulting center (can be taken from the consulting type settings in the service). Multiple consulting centers can be specified comma-separated |

The name and location of the CSV file is set in the _application.properties_ via the ``consultant.import.filename``.

## Start import

The import of the consultants can be done by calling the endpoint __/users/consultants/import__ at the UserService (e.g. with Postman). It should be noted that a valid keycloak token of a technical user with the role _"technical"_ must be passed. The call is possible 1x per minute.

### Import log

During the import, a log is written to a file. This file is also located in the root directory of the UserService and has the name 
"consultants-import.txt". In addition, a timestamp is appended so that the file is not overwritten during multiple runs.

The file contains all necessary data to generate e.g. e-mails to the consultants:

- First name
- Last name
- E-mail address
- Username

## UserService: Import of advice seekers with advice

UserService can be used to import advice seekers with advice. During the import, the corresponding accounts are created in Keycloak, in Rocket.Chat and in the application database. In addition, an initial consultation with welcome message is created. The consultation is assigned to the specified consultation center and the specified consultant.

The import is done via a CSV file with the following format (__The headlines must be removed for the import__):

```
id_old,username,email,consultant_id,postcode,agency_id,pw
219344,helpseeker,asker@problem.com,fc68b24e-bc0f-4cb5-a215-7bef0d79ee2d,53111,168,jjuasd8ยง$jk!
